# CompSoc Code of Conduct

_**This Code of Conduct is specifically for the #compsoc channel on the ImaginaryNet IRC network. It also applies to any bridged networks, such as Slack or Discord. It does not inherently apply to other channels in any of the aforementioned networks, nor does it apply to other CompSoc gatherings, such as STMUs.**_

CompSoc aims to be a nice place for anyone interested in Informatics to chat about their interests.

**We do not tolerate harassment of people in any form, including but not limited to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. Expect action from an op if you break the rule.**

With that in mind, there is a single rule:

*   Be nice

Not being nice could include:

*   Feigned surprise. When someone says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what X is‚Äù, you don‚Äôt say ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know what X is?!‚Äù or ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe you don‚Äôt know what X is!‚Äù.
*   Well-actuallys. That is the pedantic corrections that don‚Äôt make a difference to the conversation that‚Äôs happening.
*   Fanboy-ism. Just because Programming Language X has feature Y doesn't mean everyone who doesn't use it is making the biggest mistake of their lives.
*   Trolling. Posting something for the sole purpose of starting an argument or annoying other people is stupid.
*   Excessive conspiracy-theorying. Consider making your own channel if you feel the need to negatively comment on everything related to a (reasonable) subject.
*   Bad faith arguments.


If you feel that another person is violating the rule, or you have other concerns, please contact one of the ops via a PM.
